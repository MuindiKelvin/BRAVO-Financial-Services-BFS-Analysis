BRAVO Financial Services (BFS) is a local company that specializes in offering small business loans. Compared to the previous year, loan applications surged by more than 200%, which can be attributed to the group’s stepped-up online advertising efforts. Over ninety percent of loan applications and business leads originate from search engines and digital advertisements. While the company has a great focus on digital marketing, the loan application process seems to be completely manual. This involved the online submission of information such as gender, marital status, number of dependents, education, income, etc Loan decisions are manually categorized into ‘approved’ or ‘rejected.’ Some of these have been used in the approval decision and all applications go through the loan team.
Due to the recent upturn in loan applications, a similar process has led to a lack of skills, extended approval times, and greater possible operational and control risks. The current operating model puts a limit on this growth. Currently working as the Data Team Manager at BFS, I have been given the responsibility of developing a solution that will solve the organization’s major resourcing and control issues. The idea is to build and sustain several semi-automated activities that would enhance the existing loans team while allowing them to spend more time with the customers.
